Hello everyone! This is our implementation of a recipe app that takes the user's available ingredients as input and suggests a recipe with the fewest missing ingredients using the Spoonacular API.
We are a team of beginners, and this is our first experience creating a mobile app, using React Native, and integrating an app with an API. We hope you enjoy!
